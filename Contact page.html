<h3>Driving directions:</h3>

<h3>CanAssist and its TeenWork program are located at UVic in a building called the Centre for Athletics, Recreation and Special Abilities (CARSA), which is located at the corner of McKenzie Avenue and Gabriola Road. </h3>

<h3>If you are approaching UVic from McKenzie Avenue (heading east), you can park in two nearby places: the first is the CARSA parkade, which is accessed by turning right onto Vikes Way from McKenzie; the second is by turning right onto Gabriola Road from McKenzie and then left into parking Lot 2.</h3>

<h3> If you are taking UVic's Ring Road, turn right from the Ring onto Gabriola Road. Then turn right into Lot 2. </h3>

<h3> View a parking map of UVic's campus  (the CARSA building is blue and located near the top of the page in the centre). View an accessibility map of campus. </h3>

<h3> Parking pass dispensers, which accept cash and credit cards, are located in each lot. There are also parking meters alongside the Campus Security building in Lot 2. </h3>
